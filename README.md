This is my Cross Course Project during my first year as a Front End student. 

## Description

This project was one of our first projects during my first year studying Front End.
I was first tasked with designing a site according to a given brief. Later on in my studies I had to code it using HTML and CSS.
Finally I was tasked with adding Javascript to make it functional. This was a process spanning over a whole school year.

The target audience were gamers aged 18 to 25 who are interested in computer games.
The page was an online store.
The products on the page are fetched from WordPress using an api call, and displayed dynamically. The same applies to the product specific page.

All images and logo were provided. The logo has been updated by me.
